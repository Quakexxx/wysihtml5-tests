* WebKit: Editable elements can also be achieved by setting "-webkit-user-modify: read-write;" via CSS
* IE: The paste event (which is neat for parsing/sanitizing HTML before being inserted into editable elements) requires the user to opt-in in order to allow the javascript to access the clipboardData
* IE: URLs starting with www., http://, https://, ftp://, gopher://, mailto:, new:, snews:, telnet:, wasis:, file://, nntp://, newsrc:, ldap://, ldaps://, outlook:, mic:// and url: will automatically be auto-linked when either the user inserts them via copy&paste or presses the space bar when the caret is directly after such an url. This behavior cannot easily be avoided since the logic is hardcoded in the mshtml.dll (related blog post on msdn http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ieinternals/archive/2009/09/17/prevent-automatic-hyperlinking-in-contenteditable-html.aspx)
